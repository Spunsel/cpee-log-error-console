# CPEE Log Error Console - Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
A comprehensive debugging interface for CPEE (Cloud Process Execution Engine) that provides visual workflow analysis, step-by-step execution tracking, and intelligent graph rendering.

## âœ… Completed Features

### Core Architecture
- [x] **Object-Oriented Design**: Implemented `CPEEStep` and `CPEEInstance` classes in `/src/modules/`
- [x] **Modular Structure**: Organized code into `core/`, `modules/`, `services/`, `components/`, `utils/`, and `parsers/`
- [x] **Service Layer**: Created `LogService`, `InstanceService`, and `CPEEService` for data management

### Graph Visualization
- [x] **CPEE Graph Rendering**: Integrated authentic CPEE WfAdaptor for input/output tree visualization
- [x] **Mermaid Graph Support**: Added Mermaid.js integration for intermediate workflow diagrams
- [x] **Multiple Renderer Isolation**: Solved conflicts between multiple graph instances
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Implemented horizontal scrolling for intermediate graphs
- [x] **Custom Styling**: Applied white backgrounds and black borders for consistent appearance

### User Interface
- [x] **Step Navigation**: Next/Previous buttons with smooth transitions
- [x] **Instance Management**: Sidebar with multiple CPEE instance support
- [x] **Content Sections**: Organized display for Input/Output trees and intermediate steps
- [x] **Loading States**: Visual feedback during graph rendering
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for parsing and rendering errors

### Data Processing
- [x] **Log Parsing**: YAML and text log processing with step extraction
- [x] **Content Cleaning**: Automatic removal of headers, comments, and formatting
- [x] **Validation**: Input validation for both CPEE XML and Mermaid syntax
- [x] **URL Parameters**: Support for direct instance/step linking

### Testing & Development
- [x] **Test Files**: Created `test_cpee_graph_from_xml.html` and `test_mermaid_graph_from_raw.html`
- [x] **Development Tools**: Integrated browser dev tools and console logging
- [x] **Error Debugging**: Comprehensive error messages and fallback content
